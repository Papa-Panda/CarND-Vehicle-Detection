## Vehicle Detection Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

#### Code Organization
--

The code is organized in following files:


* **setup.py** Downloads the vehicle/non-vehicle zip data and create a pickle file containg features.
* **filters.py** Set of utility functions for computing hog, color and spatial filters.
* **classifier.py** Import the features created by setup.py and trains a linear SVM classifier
* **tracker.py** The implementaiton of our main pipeline. 


### How to Run
--
1. Download the data and create a feature matrix. 
```
python setup.py
```
2. Train the classifier
```
python classifier.py
```
3. Run the tracker
```
python tracker video/project_video.mp4
```

### Pipeline

The description of our vechicle detection follows:

####1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for hog / color feature is in `features.py:extract_features():line#98`.

The first step was to train a classifier for detecting vechicles in our test vidoe. For this we already have a dataset of vehicle and non-vehicle images. We used a combination of HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), histogram and spatial filters to train our classifier.

For HOG features, we used all the color channels in `YCrCb` colorspace. The colorspace and number of channel were decided through experimentation with a training/validation set (Explained more 

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

####2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of parameters and...

####3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

The code for SVM trainer is in `train.py:train():line#9`. This file loads a pickle file containing the feature matrix. The feature matrix is generated by `setup.py:preprocess()`. 

The data was split into training/validation/test set. To avoid the bias in data because of the time series nature of GTI dataset, we take about 70% of the images in sequence of the stored file on disk as training, 15% of next set of images as validation and the remaining 15% as the test set. The KITTI dataset is shuffled and then we split it into 70/15/15% training/validation/test set. We ensured that output class is roughly balanced betwen all these datsets. 

A Linear SVM was trained using the training data. We did basic parameter tunning by manually changing the value of `C` parameter and testing the accuracy on the validation set. Finally the value of 1.0 was chosen with the best accuracy. 

###Sliding Window Search

####1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

####2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


####2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
